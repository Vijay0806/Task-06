a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing
   the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

     class Movie{
        constructor(tittle,studio,rating){
            this.tittle=tittle;
            this.studio=studio;
            this.rating=rating;
        }
    }
    var c1=new Movie("thunivu","lyca","PG13");
    console.log(c1);

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

 class Movie{
        
        constructor(tittle,studio,rating="PG"){
            this.tittle=tittle;
            this.studio=studio;
            this.rating=rating;
        }
    }
    var c1=new Movie("thunivu","lyca","yes");
    console.log(c1);

c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies
   in the input array with a rating of "PG".  You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

      class Movie{
        constructor(tittle,studio,rating){
            this.tittle=tittle;
            this.studio=studio;
            this.rating=rating;
        }
         getGp(){
            
            var temp=[];
            if(this.rating=="PG"){
            temp.push(this.tittle);
            }
            return temp.join(" ");
        }
    }
    var c1=new Movie("thunivu","lyca","PG");
    var c2=new Movie("varisu","sun pictures","PG")
    var c3=new Movie("vadivasal","lyca","PS13")
    console.log(c1.getGp(),c2.getGp(),c3.getGp());

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, 
   and the rating “PG­13”

   class Movie{
        constructor(tittle,studio,rating){
            this.tittle=tittle;
            this.studio=studio;
            this.rating=rating;
        }
        
    }
    var c1=new Movie("“Casino Royale”","“Eon Productions”","PG13");
   
    console.log(c1);
